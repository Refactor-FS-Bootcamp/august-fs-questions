<h1> <b>React Excerise</b> </h1>:

Exercise 1: Hello World!

This will asses if you actually know HTML, which is one of the many prerequisites before learning React. 
<br>
- Step 1: Start by rendering a square with a background color. 
- Step 2: Inside the square, render "Hello, World!".

Exercise 2: Capturing User Clicks

What makes a web app different from a static website? A web app is interactive. Of course, there's more to web apps than capturing clicks, but it's important to start from the basics.
<br>
This exercise gets you started with event handling, which is a basic concept not only in React but also in JavaScript (which is again another pre-requisite before learning React).
<br>
Using the native HTML "button" tag, capture the click event and alert the message, "Clicked!".
<br>
Take note that capturing events such as clicks is done differently in React than it is in JavaScript.

Exercise 3: Custom Component

In the previous exercise, we used the HTML "button" tag. But much of the power that React provides to us developers is being able to create our own components and reuse them.
<br>
You'll be creating more complicated custom components than a simple button in the near future, but we all gotta start somewhere.
<br>
In this exercise, build your own Button component and render it three times. On user click, it should alert which button was clicked:

<br>
The custom component should accept an onClick prop. On render, it should render the children betwen the button. This is the text you want for the button.
<br>
Think of it like the HTML "button" tag. Whatever text you place between the opening and closing tag is rendered between the button when you inspect the element in your browser developer console.
<br>
On user click, it should alert which button was clicked.
